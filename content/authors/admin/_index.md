My research aims to understand the role of social learning/ cultural evolution in shaping animal vocal signals at both ecological and evolutionary time frames. I am also interested in  how social learning is modulated by other evolutionary factors and  the possible macro-evolutionary consequences of these processes. I tackle these questions by studying the communication systems of (mostly neotropical) taxa, making use of 'single species' behavioral studies, comparative phylogenetic methods and cutting-edge acoustic analyses.

I'm deeply involved in the development of computational tools for bioacoustic analyses. I have created the R package warbleR that provides functions to streamline high-throughput acoustic analysis of animal sounds. I also made available two R packages, Rraven and NatureSounds, that aim to simplify the use of R for bioacoustic research. More recently I released  the R packages baRulho, to quantify acoustic signal transmission and degradation, and ohun, to optimize automatic detection. New functions as well as other more elaborated analyses are detailed in my blog Bioacoustics in R.
