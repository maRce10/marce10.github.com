<p>I’m a Mexican student with a self-motivated and deeply involved in ecology, evolution, and behavior studies utilizing bioacoustic signals, and with a love for open-source analysis languages and tools. In my master’s degree in the University of Costa Rica with the tutorship of Marcelo, we are aiming to identify the mechanisms shaping acoustic structure in the cultural evolution of songs in the lekking Long-billed Hermit hummingbird (<em>Phaethornis longirostris</em>) using 50 years of acoustic data.</p>
