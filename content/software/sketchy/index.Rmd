The package is intended to facilitate the use of research compendiums for data analysis in the R environment. Standard research compendiums provide a easily recognizable means for organizing digital materials, allowing  other researchers to inspect, reproduce, and build upon that research. 

Unlike other R packages for creating research compendiums (e.g. [vertical](https://github.com/CrumpLab/vertical), [rrtools](https://github.com/benmarwick/rrtools)), `sketchy` isn't  wedded to a particular folder structure. Currently the package provides `r length(compendiums)` alternative structures (see object `compendiums`) and allows users to modify or input their own structures.   

To install the latest developmental version from [github](https://github.com/) you will need the R package [remotes](https://cran.r-project.org/package=remotes):

```{r 1, eval = FALSE}

# From github
remotes::install_github("maRce10/sketchy")

#load package
library(sketchy)

```

## Default compendium skeletons

Compendiums can be set up with the function `make_compendium()`. The function creates the folder/subfolder structure and prints a diagram of the skeleton in the console:

### Basic compendium

```{r 3, eval = TRUE}

path = tempdir()

# load data
data(compendiums)

make_compendium(name = "proyect_x", path = path, format = "basic")

```


&nbsp; 

(*in these examples the compendiums are created in a temporary directory, change 'path' to create it in a different directory*)


### Alternative structures

We can use folder structures from other sources. For instance, in this example we use the structured suggested by Wilson *et al.* (2017):

```{r 4, eval = TRUE}

make_compendium(name = "proyect_z", path = path, format = "large_compendium")

```

&nbsp; 

When creating a compendium that includes a "manuscript" folder the package adds a "manuscript_template.Rmd" file for facilitating paper writing within the compendium itself.


We can check all compendium structure available as follows:

```{r 5, eval = TRUE}

for(i in 1:length(compendiums)){
  print("---------------", quote = FALSE)
  print(names(compendiums)[i], quote = FALSE)
  print_skeleton(folders = compendiums[[i]]$skeleton)
}
  
```
