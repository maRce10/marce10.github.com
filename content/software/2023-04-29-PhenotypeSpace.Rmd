[PhenotypeSpace](https://github.com/maRce10/PhenotypeSpace) is intended to facilitate the quantification of phenotypic space features.

The package offers functions for:

   - Estimate absolute values of phenotypic spaces
   - Compare trait spaces across groups
   - Modify output formats to facilitate statistical analysis
   
All functions allow the parallelization of tasks, which distributes the tasks among several processors to improve computational efficiency. 


To install the latest developmental version from [github](https://github.com/) you will need the R package [remotes](https://cran.r-project.org/package=remotes):

```{r, eval = FALSE}
remotes::install_github("maRce10/PhenotypeSpace")

#load package
library(PhenotypeSpace)

```
