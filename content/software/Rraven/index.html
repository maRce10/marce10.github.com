<p>The <code>Rraven</code> package is designed to facilitate the exchange of data between R and <a href="https://ravensoundsoftware.com">Raven sound analysis software</a> (<a href="https://www.birds.cornell.edu/home">Cornell Lab of Ornithology</a>). <a href="https://ravensoundsoftware.com">Raven</a> provides very powerful tools for the analysis of (animal) sounds. R can simplify the automatization of complex routines of analyses. Furthermore, R packages as <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/package=warbleR">warbleR</a>, <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/package=seewave">seewave</a> and <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/package=monitoR">monitoR</a> (among others) provide additional methods of analysis, working as a perfect complement for those found in <a href="https://ravensoundsoftware.com">Raven</a>. Hence, bridging these applications can largely expand the bioacoustician’s toolkit.</p>
<p>Currently, most analyses in <a href="https://ravensoundsoftware.com">Raven</a> cannot be run in the background from a command terminal. Thus, most <code>Rraven</code> functions are design to simplify the exchange of data between the two programs.</p>
<p>Install/load the package from CRAN as follows:</p>
<pre class="r"><code># From CRAN 
install.packages(&quot;Rraven&quot;)

#load package
library(Rraven)</code></pre>
<p>To install the latest developmental version from <a href="https://github.com/">github</a> you will need the R package <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/package=devtools">remotes</a>:</p>
<pre class="r"><code># From github
remotes::install_github(&quot;maRce10/Rraven&quot;)

#load package
library(Rraven)</code></pre>
<p>The package vignette provides detailed examples for each function in <code>Rraven</code>, including both the R code as well as the additional steps in <a href="https://ravensoundsoftware.com">Raven</a> required to fully accomplished the analyses. You can pull it up as follows:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>vignette(&quot;Rraven&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>The animations explaining additional steps in <a href="https://ravensoundsoftware.com">Raven</a> are shown in more detail on the <a href="https://github.com/maRce10/Rraven">github</a> version of this vignette, which can be downloaded as follows (saves the file “Rraven.github.html” in your current working directory):</p>
<pre class="r"><code>download.file(url = &quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/maRce10/Rraven/master/gifs/Rraven.hitgub.html&quot;, 
destfile = &quot;Rraven.hitgub.html&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>The downloaded file can be opened by any internet browser.</p>
