<p>The <a href="https://marce10.github.io/suwo/">suwo</a> package aims to simplify the
retrieval of nature media (mostly photos, audio files and videos) across
multiple online biodiversity databases. Such media are increasingly used in
diverse fields ranging from ecology and evolutionary biology
(e.g. trait evolution) to wildlife monitoring and conservation (training
species detection models).</p>
<p>The main features of the package are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Obtaining media metadata from online repositories</li>
<li>Downloading associated media files</li>
<li>Updating data sets with new records</li>
</ul>
