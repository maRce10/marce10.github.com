[baRulho](https://cran.r-project.org/package=baRulho) is intended to facilitate acoustic analysis of (animal) sound transmission experiments, which typically aim to quantify changes in signal structure when transmitted in a given habitat by broadcasting and re-recording animal sounds at increasing distances. The package offers a workflow with functions to prepare the data set for analysis as well as to calculate and visualize several degradation metrics, including blur ratio, signal-to-noise ratio, excess attenuation and envelope correlation among others (Dabelsteen et al 1993).

Install/load the package from CRAN as follows:

```{r, eval = FALSE}

# From CRAN would be
#install.packages("baRulho")

#load package
library(baRulho)

```

To install the latest developmental version from [github](https://github.com/) you will need the R package [remotes](https://cran.r-project.org/package=remotes):

```{r, eval = FALSE}

# From github
remotes::install_github("maRce10/baRulho")

#load package
library(baRulho)

```
