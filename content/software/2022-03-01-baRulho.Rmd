[baRulho](https://cran.r-project.org/package=baRulho) is intended to facilitate the implementation of (animal) sound transmission experiments, which typically aim to quantify changes in signal structure when transmitted in a given habitat by broadcasting and re-recording animal sounds at increasing distances. A common sequence of steps to experimentally test hypotheses related to sound transmission is depicted in the following diagram:

[baRulho](https://marce10.github.io/baRulho/) offers functions for critical steps in this workflow (those in black, including 'checks') that required acoustic data manipulation and analysis.

The main features of the package are:

 - The use of loops to apply tasks through sounds referenced in a selection table (sensu [warbleR](https://cran.r-project.org/package=warbleR))
 - The production of image files with graphic representations of sound in time and/or frequency that let users verify acoustic analyses 
 - The use of annotation tables as the object format to input acoustic data and annotations and to output results 
 - The use of parallelization to distribute tasks among several cores to improve computational efficiency


[baRulho](https://marce10.github.io/baRulho/) builds upon functions and data formats from the [warbleR](https://cran.r-project.org/package=warbleR) and [seewave](https://cran.r-project.org/package=seewave) packages, so some experience with these packages is advised.

Take a look at the vignettes for an overview of the main features of the packages:

- [Align test sounds](https://marce10.github.io/baRulho/articles/align_test_sounds.html)
- [Quantify degradation](https://marce10.github.io/baRulho/articles/quantify_degradation.html)

## Installing baRulho

Install/load the package from CRAN as follows:

```{r, eval = FALSE}

# From CRAN would be
# install.packages("baRulho")

# load package
library(baRulho)
```

To install the latest developmental version from [github](https://github.com/) you will need the R package [remotes](https://cran.r-project.org/package=remotes):

```{r, eval = FALSE}

# From github
remotes::install_github("maRce10/baRulho")

# load package
library(baRulho)
```

Further system requirements due to the dependency [seewave](https://rug.mnhn.fr/seewave/) may be needed. Take a look a [this link]( https://rug.mnhn.fr/seewave/inst.html) for instruction on how to install/troubleshoot these external dependencies. 

## Other packages

The packages [seewave](https://cran.r-project.org/package=seewave) and  [tuneR](https://cran.r-project.org/package=seewave) provide a huge variety of functions for acoustic analysis and manipulation. They mostly work on wave objects already imported into the R environment. The package [warbleR](https://cran.r-project.org/package=warbleR) provides functions to visualize and measure sounds already referenced in annotation tables, similar to [baRulho](https://marce10.github.io/baRulho/). The package [Rraven](https://cran.r-project.org/package=Rraven) facilitates the exchange of data between R and [Raven sound analysis software](https://ravensoundsoftware.com) ([Cornell Lab of Ornithology](https://www.birds.cornell.edu/home)) and can be very helpful for incorporating Raven as the annotating tool into acoustic analysis workflow in R. The package [ohun](https://github.com/ropensci/ohun) works on automated detection of sound events, providing functions to diagnose and optimize detection routines.
