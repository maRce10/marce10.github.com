abstract: Vocal learning in birds is typically restricted to a sensitive period early
  in life, with the few exceptions reported in songbirds and parrots. Here, we present
  evidence of open-ended vocal learning in a hummingbird, the third avian group with
  vocal learning. We studied vocalizations at four leks of the long-billed hermit Phaethornis  longirostris during
  a four-year period. Individuals produce a single song repertoire, although several song-types
  can coexist at a single lek. We found that nine of 49 birds recorded on multiple
  days (18%) changed their song-type between consecutive recordings. Three of these
  birds replaced song-types twice. Moreover, the earliest estimated age when song replacement
  occurred ranged from186 to 547 days (mean 307 days) and all nine birds who replaced
  song-types produced a crystallized song before replacement. The findings indicate that
  song-type replacement is distinct from an initial early learning sensitive period.
  As half of lekking males do not survive past the first year of life in this species,
  song learning may well extend throughout the lifespan. This behaviour would be
  convergent to vocal learning programmes found in parrots and songbirds.
