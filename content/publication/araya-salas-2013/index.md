abstract: Vocal learning in birds is typically restricted to a sensitive period early
  inlife, with the few exceptions reported in songbirds and parrots. Here, wepresent
  evidence of open-ended vocal learning in a hummingbird, thethird avian group with
  vocal learning. We studied vocalizations at fourleks of the long-billed hermitPhaethornis  longirostrisduring
  a four-yearperiod. Individuals produce a single song repertoire, although severalsong-types
  can coexist at a single lek. We found that nine of 49 birdsrecorded on multiple
  days (18%) changed their song-type between consecu-tive recordings. Three of these
  birds replaced song-types twice. Moreover,the earliest estimated age when song replacement
  occurred ranged from186 to 547 days (meanÂ¼307 days) and all nine birds who replaced
  song-types produced a crystallized song before replacement. The findings indicatethat
  song-type replacement is distinct from an initial early learning sensitiveperiod.
  As half of lekking males do not survive past the first year of life inthis species,
  song learning may well extend throughout the lifespan. This be-haviour would be
  convergent to vocal learning programmes found inparrots and songbirds.
