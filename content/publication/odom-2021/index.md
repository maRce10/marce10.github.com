abstract: 'Historically, bird song complexity was thought to evolve primarily through
  sexual selection on males; yet, in many species, both sexes sing and selection pressure
  on both sexes may be broader. Previous research suggests competition for mates and
  resources during short, synchronous breeding seasons leads to more elaborate male
  songs at high, temperate latitudes. Furthermore, we expect male–female song structure
  and elaboration to be more similar at lower, tropical latitudes, where longer breeding
  seasons and year-round territoriality yield similar social selection pressures in
  both sexes. However, studies seldom take both types of selective pressures and sexes
  into account. We examined song in both sexes in 15 populations of nine-fairy-wren
  species (Maluridae), a Southern Hemisphere clade with female song. We compared song
  elaboration (in both sexes) and sexual song dimorphism to latitude and life-history
  variables tied to sexual and social selection pressures and sex roles. Our results
  suggest that song elaboration evolved in part due to sexual competition in males:
  male songs were longer than female songs in populations with low male survival and
  less male provisioning. Also, female songs evolved independently of male songs:
  female songs were slower paced than male songs, although only in less synchronously
  breeding populations. We also found male and female songs were more similar when
  parental care was more equal and when male survival was high, which provides strong
  evidence that sex role similarity correlates with male–female song similarity. Contrary
  to Northern Hemisphere latitudinal patterns, male and female songs were more similar
  at higher, temperate latitudes. These results suggest that selection on song can
  be sex specific, with male song elaboration favored in contexts with stronger sexual
  selection. At the same time, selection pressures associated with sex role similarity
  appear to favor sex role similarity in song structure.'
