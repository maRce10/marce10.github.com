abstract: 'We use allometric analysis to explore how acoustic signals scale on individual
  body size and to test hypotheses about the factors shap-ing  relationships  between  signals  and  body  size.  Across  case  studies  spanning  birds,  crickets,  tree  crickets,  and  tree  frogs,  we  find  that
  most signal traits had low coefficients of variation, shallow allometric scalings,
  and little dispersion around the allometric function. We relate variation in these
  measures to the shape of mate preferences and the level of condition dependence
  of signal traits. We find 3 major patterns: 1) signal traits associated with closed
  mate preferences had lower coefficients of variation and shallower allometries than
  signal traits with open preferences, 2) signal traits with higher levels of condition
  dependence had higher coefficients of variation and steeper allometries, and 3)
  the relationship between condition dependence and allometry varied with preference
  shape. We find no  difference  in  coefficient  of  variation  or  allometry  between  advertisement  and  aggressive  acoustic  signals.  Together,  our  findings  suggest
  2 main conclusions: 1) most acoustic signals do not appear to have been selected
  to function as indicators of body size and 2) an interplay between the form of selection
  and body sizeâ€“related cost/benefit relationships of trait expression has great potential
  to explain variation in sexual allometries'
