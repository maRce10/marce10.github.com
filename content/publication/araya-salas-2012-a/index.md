abstract: The nightingale, the lark ascending; the cuckoo, the dawn chorus; since
  ancient times man has found beauty in birdsong. It appeals to our senses. It inspires
  composers. But is it music? Marcelo Araya-Salas  listens  to  the  nightingale  wren  and  tries  to  find  out  if  it  is  singing
  in tune.
