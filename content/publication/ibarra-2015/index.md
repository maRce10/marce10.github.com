abstract: We present an interdisciplinary effort to record feeding behaviors and control
  the diet of a hummingbird species (Phaethornis longirostris, the long-billed hermit
  or LBH) by developing a Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) based smart feeder.
  The system contains an RFID reader, a microcontroller, and a servo-controlled hummingbird
  feeder opener; the system is presented as a tool for studying the cognitive ability
  of the LBH species. When equipped with glass capsule RFID tags (which are mounted
  on the hummingbird), the smart feeder can provide specific diets for predetermined
  sets of hummingbirds at the discretion of biologists. This is done by reading the
  unique RFID tag on the hummingbirds and comparing the ID number with the pre-programmed
  ID numbers stored in the smart feeder. The smart feeder records the time and ID
  of each hummingbird visit. The system data is stored in a readily available SD card
  and is powered by two 9 V batteries. The detection range of the system is approximately
  9â€“11 cm. Using this system, biologists can assign the wild hummingbirds to different
  experimental groups and monitor their diets to determine if they develop a preference
  to any of the available nectars. During field testing, the smart feeder system has
  demonstrated consistent detection (when compared to detections observed by video-recordings)
  of RFID tags on hummingbirds and provides pre-designed nectars varying water and
  sugar concentrations to target individuals. The smart feeder can be applied to other
  biological and environmental studies in the future.
