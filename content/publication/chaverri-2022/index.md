abstract: Roosts are vital for the survival of many species, and how individuals choose
  one site over another is affected by various factors. In bats, for example, species
  may use stiff roosts such as caves or compliant ones such as leaves; each type requires
  not only specific morphological adaptations but also different landing manoeuvres.
  Selecting a suitable roost within those broad categories may increase landing performance,
  reducing accidents and decreasing exposure time to predators. We addressed whether
  bats select specific roost sites based on the availability of a suitable landing
  surface, which could increase landing performance. Our study focused on Spix's disc-winged
  bats (Thyroptera tricolor), a species known to roost within developing tubular leaves.
  As previous studies show that this species relies on the leaves' apex for safe landing
  and rapid post-landing settlement, we predicted that bats would prefer to roost
  in tubular structures with a longer apex and that landing would be consistently
  more effective on those leaves. Field observations showed that T. tricolor predominantly
  used two species for roosting, Heliconia imbricata and Calathea lutea, but they
  preferred roosting in the former. The main difference between these two plant species
  was the length of the leaf's apex (longer in H. imbricata). Experiments in a flight
  cage also showed that bats used more consistent approach and landing tactics when
  accessing leaves with a longer apex. Our results suggest that landing mechanics
  may strongly influence resource selection, especially when complex manoeuvres are
  needed to acquire those resources.
