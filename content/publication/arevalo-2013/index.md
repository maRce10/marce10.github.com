abstract: Predator-prey interactions occur regularly in nature; however, predation
  events are difficult to observe in the canopy of tropical rain forests. We describe
  a successful capture of a Chestnut-mandibled Toucan (Ramphastos swainsonii) by a
  Collared Forest-Falcon (Micrastur semitorquatus) in Carara National Park, Costa
  Rica. The predator-prey interaction lasted for ∼30 min from the moment of the first
  wounding strike in the canopy to the killing of the toucan on the ground. During
  the predation process, the falcon engaged in multiple attacks from different directions
  at the sub-canopy level. We video recorded a total of 323.3 sec tracks during the
  predation event to produce a detailed description of the behavior of both species.
  In addition, we analyzed the structure of the call of the toucan while being attacked
  and compared that with a regular call of another individual recorded at a different
  time in the same area. The toucan produced a distress call with strong harmonics
  and a broad-band rattling sound as a threatening call. We comment on the possible
  function of the calls.
