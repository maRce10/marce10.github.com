 abstract = {We investigated the ontogenetic changes of two call types, the inquiry call and the response call, whichcomprise an interactive communication system in Spix's disc-winged bats,Thyroptera tricolor.Wedocumented structural changes on both inquiry and response calls during ontogeny by recording singleindividual vocalizations in aflight cage and triggering response calls with playbacks of adult inquiry calls.Most ontogenetic changes in response calls were sex dependent. In addition, individuality was high forboth call types across age categories. Despite the observed changes during development, both call typesresembled the structure of adult calls from early ontogenetic stages, suggesting little influence of sociallearning in call development. Finally, we found sex dependent ontogenetic changes and high levels ofindividuality of calls early in life, which may indicate additional functionality in sex and pup recognition.Overall, thefindings bring novel insight into the complex developmental process of the call typescomprising the communication systems of Spix's disc-winged bats, and contribute to a better under-standing of signal development in complex social communication systems.},
