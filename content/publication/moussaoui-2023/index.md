abstract: 'In some species, the ability to acquire new vocalizations persists into adult-
hood and may be an important mediator of social interactions. While it is
generally assumed that vocal learning persists undiminished throughout the
lifespan of these open-ended learners, the stability of this trait remains largely
unexplored. We hypothesize that vocal learning exhibits senescence, as is typi-
cal of complex cognitive traits, and that this decline relates to age-dependent
changes in social behaviour. The budgerigar (Melopsittacus undulatus), an
open-ended learner that develops new contact call types that are shared
with social associates upon joining new flocks, provides a robust assay for
measuring the effects of ageing on vocal learning ability. We formed captive
flocks of 4 previously unfamiliar adult males of the same age class, either
‘young adults’ (6 mo−1 y) or ‘older adults’ (≥ 3 y), and concurrently tracked
changes in contact call structure and social interactions over time. Older
adults exhibited decreased vocal diversity, which may be related to sparser
and weaker affiliative bonds observed in older adults. Older adults, however,
displayed equivalent levels of vocal plasticity and vocal convergence
compared to young adults, suggesting that many components of vocal
learning are largely maintained into later adulthood in an open-ended learner.'
