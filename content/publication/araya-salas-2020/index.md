abstract: We investigated the ontogenetic changes of two call types, the inquiry call
  and the response call, whichcomprise an interactive communication system in Spix's
  disc-winged bats,Thyroptera tricolor.Wedocumented structural changes on both inquiry
  and response calls during ontogeny by recording singleindividual vocalizations in
  aflight cage and triggering response calls with playbacks of adult inquiry calls.Most
  ontogenetic changes in response calls were sex dependent. In addition, individuality
  was high forboth call types across age categories. Despite the observed changes
  during development, both call typesresembled the structure of adult calls from early
  ontogenetic stages, suggesting little influence of sociallearning in call development.
  Finally, we found sex dependent ontogenetic changes and high levels ofindividuality
  of calls early in life, which may indicate additional functionality in sex and pup
  recognition.Overall, thefindings bring novel insight into the complex developmental
  process of the call typescomprising the communication systems of Spix's disc-winged
  bats, and contribute to a better under-standing of signal development in complex
  social communication systems.
