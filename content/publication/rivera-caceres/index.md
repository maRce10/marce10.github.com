abstract: Exchange of vocal signals is an important aspect of animal communication.
  Although birdsong is the premier model for understanding vocal development, the
  development of vocal interaction rules in birds and possible parallels to humans
  have been little studied.Many tropical songbirds engage in complex vocal interactions
  in the form of duets between mated pairs. In some species, duets show precise temporal
  coordination and follow rules (duet codes) governing which song type one bird uses
  to reply to each of the song types of its mate. We determined whether these duetting
  rules are acquired during early development in canebrake wrens. Results show that
  juveniles acquire a duet code by singing with a mated pair of adults and that juveniles
  gradually increase their fidelity to the code over time. Additionally, we found
  that juveniles exhibit poorer temporal coordination than adults and improve their
  coordination as time progresses. Human turn-taking, an analogous rule to temporal
  coordination, is learned during early development. We report that the ontogeny of
  vocal interaction rules in songbirds is analogous to that of human conversation
  rules.
