abstract: One  way  in  which  secondary  sexual  traits  can  influence  differential  reproductive  success  is  by  playing  a  key  role  in  the  outcome  of  direct  physical  contests  for  mates.  Here  we  describe  an  undocumented  trait  in  a  species  of  hummingbird  with  a  lek  mating  system,  the  Long-billed  hermit  (LBH,  Phaethornis  longirostris).  The  trait  under  consideration  is  a  dagger-like  structure  at  the  bill  tip,  which  we  hypothesize  is  a  secondary  sexual  trait  that  functions  as  a  sexually  dimorphic  weapon.  We  tested  our  hypothesis  by  examin-ing  5  leks  during  4  consecutive  years,  and  by  employing  morphological  analyses,  performance  experiments,  and  behavioral  observa-tions.  We  found  that  1)  adult  male  bill  tips  were  longer  and  pointier  than  their  counterparts  in  females  and  juvenile  males,  2)  juvenile  males
  acquired dagger-like tips during their transition to adulthood, 3) variation in
  bill tip morphology reflected puncture capability, and 4) males with larger and
  pointier bill tips were more successful in achieving lek territory tenure. Our study
  provides the first evidence of  sexually  dimorphic  weapons  in  bird  bills  and  stands  as  one  of  the  few  examples  of  male  weaponry  in  birds.  Our  results  suggest  a  role
  of sexual selection on the evolution of overall bill morphology, an alternative
  hypothesis to the prevailing “ecological causation” explanation for bill sexual
  dimorphism in hummingbirds
