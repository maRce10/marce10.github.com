abstract: 'Advanced cognitive abilities have long been hypothesized to be important
  in mating. Yet, most work on sexual selection has focused on morphological traits
  and its relevance for cognitive evolution is poorly understood. We studied the spatial
  memory of lekking long-billed hermits (Phaethornis longirostris) and evaluated its
  role in lek territory ownership, the magnitude of its effect compared to phenotypic
  traits expected to influence sexual selection, and whether its variation is indicated
  in the structure of mating vocal signal. Spatial memory (the ability to recall the
  position of a rewarding feeder) was compared between “territorial” and “floater”
  males. Interestingly, although spatial memory and body size both positively affected
  the probability of lek territory ownership, our results suggest a stronger effect
  of spatial memory. Bill tip length (used as weapon in agonistic interactions) also
  showed a positive but smaller effect. Load lifting during vertical flight, a measure
  of physical performance relevant to agonistic interactions, had no effect on territory
  ownership. Finally, both body size and spatial memory were indicated in the structure
  of male song: body size negatively correlated with song lowest frequency, while
  spatial memory positively predicted song consistency. Together, our findings lend
  support for cognition as a sexual selection target.'
