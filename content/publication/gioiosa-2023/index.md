abstract: The ability of an animal to detect environmental cues is crucial for its
  survival and fitness. In bats, sound certainly plays a significant role in the search
  for food, spatial navigation, and social communication. Yet, the efficiency of bat’s
  echolocation could be limited by atmospheric attenuation and background clutter.
  In this context, sound can be complemented by other sensory modalities, like smell
  or vision. Spix’s disc-winged bat (Thyroptera tricolor) uses acoustic cues from
  other group members to locate the roost (tubular unfurled leaves of plants in the
  order Zingiberales). Our research focused on how individuals find a roost that has
  not been yet occupied, considering the urge to find a suitable leaf approximately
  every day, during nighttime or in daylight. We observed the process of roost finding
  in T. tricolor in a flight cage, manipulating the audio/visual sensory input available
  for each trial. A broadband noise was broadcast in order to mask echolocation, while
  experiments conducted at night reduced significantly the amount of light. We measured
  the time needed to locate the roost under these different conditions. Results show
  that with limited visual and acoustic cues, search time increases significantly.
  In contrast bats seemed capable of using acoustic and visual cues in a similarly
  efficient manner, since roost search showed no strong differences in duration when
  bats could use only sound, only vision, or both senses at the same time. Our results
  show that non-acoustic inputs can still be an important source of information for
  finding critical resources in bats.
