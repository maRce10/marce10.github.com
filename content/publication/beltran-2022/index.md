abstract: Traits that exhibit differences between the sexes have been of special interest
  in the study of phenotypic evolution. Classic hypotheses explain sexually dimorphic
  traits via intra-sexual competition and mate selection, yet natural selection may
  also act differentially on the sexes to produce dimorphism. Natural selection can
  act either through physiological and ecological constraints on one of the sexes,
  or by modulating the strength of sexual/social selection. This predicts an association
  between the degree of dimorphism and variation in ecological environments. Here,
  we characterize the variation in hummingbird dimorphism across ecological gradients
  using rich databases of morphology, colouration and song. We show that morphological
  dimorphism decreases with elevation in the understorey and increases with elevation
  in mixed habitats, that dichromatism increases at high altitudes in open and mixed
  habitats, and that song is less complex in mixed habitats. Our results are consistent
  with flight constraints, lower predation pressure at high elevations and with habitat
  effects on song transmission. We also show that dichromatism and song complexity
  are positively associated, while tail dimorphism and song complexity are negatively
  associated. Our results suggest that key ecological factors shape sexually dimorphic
  traits, and that different communication modalities do not always evolve in tandem.
