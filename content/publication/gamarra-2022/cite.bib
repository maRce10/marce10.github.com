 abstract = {Song plays a crucial role in bird ecology and behavior, and understanding the processes that alter the production and transmission of song is fundamental to elucidate its response to changes in the environment. In this context, urban environments represent useful study systems for understanding this adaptation. To this end, we examined the song structure of the Rufous-collared Sparrow (Zonotrichia capensis) along an urban gradient in the city of Arequipa, southwestern Peru. We obtained 240 songs in total from 80 individuals, distributed inurban, subur-ban,  rural,  and  wild  areas,  and  we  analyzed  the  maximum  frequency,  minimum  frequency  and  duration  of  the  introduction  and  trill.We found significant differences in the spectral (minimum frequency) along the urban gradient. We also found that the minimum frequencies of introduction and trill were higher in urbanized areas, while the maximum frequencies and durations of both parts of the song didnot vary. The anthropogenic noise effects or vertical concrete structures in highly urbanized areas could explain variation in song traitsof this common species  in  the  city  of  Arequipa,  and  this  study  shows  that  the  minimum  frequency  of  this  species  is  the  most  susceptible  parameter  pre-senting variations in environments with different degrees of urbanization.},
