abstract: Cognitive abilities are pivotal to the performance of traits that are closely
  related to fitness. However, the selective regimes shaping the evolution of cognition,
  and differences in individual cognitive performance under different environmental
  conditions have been poorly studied. The rich environmental heterogeneity and biodiversity
  in the Neotropics present a compelling scenario where to study the functional and
  mechanistic links in the evolution of cognition. On the other hand, hummingbirds
  are a particularly interesting group in which to examine cognitive performance in
  the free-living animals. Their diet, mainly composed by nectar of flowers, varies
  in concentration, composition, and rate of renewal. These variables are easy to
  manipulate in the field, presenting excellent options for experimental setup. We
  explored cognitive performance in hummingbird species occurring in diverse environments.
  Overall, hummingbird species in the Neotropics showed similar cognitive abilities
  than species in the Nearctic region; however, our conclusions are limited by the
  few studies that have been carried out. Among different habitats, environmental
  heterogeneity seems to drive the development of cognitive abilities, however mediated
  by individual traits such as sex and social status. This could explain why, across
  all the studies, we observed important individual differences in cognitive performance.
  In our opinion, the role of these variables should be further assessed by integrating
  physiological traits, such as endocrine levels and energy balance. Thus, integrative
  and comparative studies in hummingbirds in the Neotropics could shed light on the
  different selective pressures that might have shaped the evolutionary trajectory
  of avian cognition.
