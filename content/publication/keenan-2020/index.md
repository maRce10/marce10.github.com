abstract: Many animals produce coordinated signals, but few are more striking than
  the elaborate maleâ€“female vocal duets produced by some tropical songbirds. Yet,
  little is known about the factors driving the extreme levels of vocal coordination
  between mated pairs in these taxa. We examined evolutionary patterns of duet coordination
  and their potential evolutionary drivers in Neotropical wrens (Troglodytidae), a
  songbird family well known for highly coordinated duets. Across 23 wren species,
  we show that the degree of coordination and precision with which pairs combine their
  songs into duets varies by species. This includes some species that alternate their
  song phrases with exceptional coordination to produce rapidly alternating duets
  that are highly consistent across renditions. These highly coordinated, consistent
  duets evolved independently in multiple wren species. Duet coordination and consistency
  are greatest in species with especially long breeding seasons, but neither duet
  coordination nor consistency are correlated with clutch size, conspecific abundance
  or vegetation density. These results suggest that tightly coordinated duets play
  an important role in mediating breeding behaviour, possibly by signalling commitment
  or coalition of the pair to mates and other conspecifics.
