abstract: Learning has been traditionally thought to accelerate the evolutionary change
  of behavioural traits. We evaluated the evolutionary rate of learned vocalizations
  and the interplay of morphology and ecology in the evolution of these signals. We
  examined contact calls of 51 species of Neotropical parrots from the tribe Arini.
  Parrots are ideal subjects due to their wide range of body sizes and habitats, and
  their open-ended vocal learning that allows them to modify their calls throughout
  life. We estimated the evolutionary rate of acoustic parameters of parrot contact
  calls and compared them to those of morphological traits and habitat. We also evaluated
  the effect of body mass, bill length, vegetation density and species interactions
  on acoustic parameters of contact calls while controlling for phylogeny. Evolutionary
  rates of acoustic parameters did not differ from those of our predictor variables
  except for spectral entropy, which had a significantly slower rate of evolution.
  We found support for correlated evolution of call duration, and fundamental and
  peak frequencies with body mass, and of fundamental frequency with bill length.
  The degree of sympatry between species did not have a significant effect on acoustic
  parameters. Our results suggest that parrot contact calls, which are learned acoustic
  signals, show evolutionary rates similar to those of morphological traits. This
  is the first study to our knowledge to provide evidence that change through cultural
  evolution does not necessarily accelerate the evolutionary rate of traits acquired
  through life-long vocal learning.
