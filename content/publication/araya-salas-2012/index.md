abstract: 'Signals in animal communication are commonly judged as aesthetically appealing
  by human standards. This is particularly common for birdsong, often equated to musical
  compositions. No formal test, however, has analysed their harmonic properties. Musical
  intervals are based on the same physical characteristics of sound that underlie
  animal vocal signals. Thus, animals may use these intervals as rules to organize
  their vocalizations in a similar way as music. I tested a prediction derived from
  this hypothesis, that frequency ratios of adjacent notes in birdsong are closer
  to harmonic intervals than expected by chance. I determined to what degree the intervals
  created by adjacent notes of the song of nightingale wrens (Microcerculus philomela)
  conform to harmonic intervals. Songs from 81 birds across the entire distribution
  range of the species were analysed, comparing the intervals formed by adjacent notes
  to three different musical scales: chromatic, major diatonic and major pentatonic.
  Comparisons were made based on null model distributions. From 243 comparisons, only
  six (~2%) were significantly close to harmonic intervals, suggesting no consistent
  use of harmonic intervals. The frequency of the notes is the most varying song parameter
  in this species. If the frequencies are not determined by harmonic intervals in
  this species, it seems less likely that it happens in other birds with more complex
  song elements. Documented musical properties in birds might be caused by cultural
  biases of the listener or misunderstanding of the physics of musical compositions.'
