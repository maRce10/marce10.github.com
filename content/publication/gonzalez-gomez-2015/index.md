abstract: In the context of global change the possible loss of biodiversity has been
  identified as a major concern. Biodiversity could be seriously threatened as a direct
  consequence of changes in availability of food, changing thermal conditions, and
  loss and fragmentation of habitat. Considering the magnitude of global change, an
  understanding of the mechanisms involved in coping with a changing environment is
  urgent. We explore the hypothesis that species and individuals experiencing highly
  variable environments are more likely to develop a wider range of responses to handle
  the different and unpredictable conditions imposed by global change. In the case
  of vertebrates, the responses to the challenges imposed by unpredictable perturbations
  ultimately are linked to cognitive abilities allowing the solving of problems, and
  the maximization of energy intake. Our models were hummingbirds, which offer a particularly
  compelling group in which to examine the functional and mechanistic links between
  behavioral and energetic strategies in individuals experiencing different degrees
  of social and environmental heterogeneity.
