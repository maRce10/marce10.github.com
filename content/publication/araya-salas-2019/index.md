abstract: Vocal learning, in which animals modify their vocalizations based on social
  experience, has evolved in several lineages of mammals and birds, including humans.
  Despite much attention, the question of how this key cognitive trait has evolved
  remains unanswered. The motor theory for the origin of vocal learning posits that
  neural centres specialized for vocal learning arose from adjacent areas in the brain
  devoted to general motor learning. One prediction of this hypothesis is that visual
  displays that rely on complex motor patterns may also be learned in taxa with vocal
  learning. While learning of both spoken and gestural languages is well documented
  in humans, the occurrence of learned visual displays has rarely been examined in
  non-human animals. We tested for geographical variation consistent with learning
  of visual displays in long-billed hermits (Phaethornis longirostris), a lek-mating
  hummingbird that, like humans, has both learned vocalizations and elaborate visual
  displays. We found lek-level signatures in both vocal parameters and visual display
  features, including display element proportions, sequence syntax and fine-scale
  parameters of elements. This variation was not associated with genetic differentiation
  between leks. In the absence of genetic differences, geographical variation in vocal
  signals at small scales is most parsimoniously attributed to learning, suggesting
  a significant role of social learning in visual display ontogeny. The co-occurrence
  of learning in vocal and visual displays would be consistent with a parallel evolution
  of these two signal modalities in this species.
