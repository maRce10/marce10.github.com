abstract: Animals produce a wide array of sounds with highly variable acoustic structures.
  It is possible to understand the causes and consequences of this variation across
  taxa with phylogenetic comparative analyses. Acoustic and evolutionary analyses
  are rapidly increasing in sophistication such that choosing appropriate acoustic
  and evolutionary approaches is increasingly difficult. However, the correct choice
  of analysis can have profound effects on output and evolutionary inferences. Here,
  we identify and address some of the challenges for this growing field by providing
  a roadmap for quantifying and comparing sound in a phylogenetic context for researchers
  with a broad range of scientific backgrounds. Sound, as a continuous, multidimensional
  trait can be particularly challenging to measure because it can be hard to identify
  variables that can be compared across taxa and it is also no small feat to process
  and analyse the resulting high-dimensional acoustic data using approaches that are
  appropriate for subsequent evolutionary analysis. Additionally, terminological inconsistencies
  and the role of learning in the development of acoustic traits need to be considered.
  Phylogenetic comparative analyses also have their own sets of caveats to consider.
  We provide a set of recommendations for delimiting acoustic signals into discrete,
  comparable acoustic units. We also present a three-stage workflow for extracting
  relevant acoustic data, including options for multivariate analyses and dimensionality
  reduction that is compatible with phylogenetic comparative analysis. We then summarize
  available phylogenetic comparative approaches and how they have been used in comparative
  bioacoustics, and address the limitations of comparative analyses with behavioural
  data. Lastly, we recommend how to apply these methods to acoustic data across a
  range of study systems. In this way, we provide an integrated framework to aid in
  quantitative analysis of cross-taxa variation in animal sounds for comparative phylogenetic
  analysis. In addition, we advocate the standardization of acoustic terminology across
  disciplines and taxa, adoption of automated methods for acoustic feature extraction,
  and establishment of strong data archival practices for acoustic recordings and
  data analyses. Combining such practices with our proposed workflow will greatly
  advance the reproducibility, biological interpretation, and longevity of comparative
  bioacoustic studies.
