abstract: 'Although song development in songbirds has been much studied as an analogue
  of language development in humans, the development of vocal interaction rules has
  been relatively neglected in both groups. Duetting avian species provide an ideal
  model to address the acquisition of interaction rules as duet structure involves
  time and pattern-specific relationships among the vocalizations from different individuals.
  In this study, we address the development of the most striking properties of duets:
  the specific answering rules that individual s use to link their own phrase types
  to those of their partners (duet codes) and precise temporal coordination. By performing
  two removal experiments in canebrake wrens (Cantorchilus zeledoni), we show that
  individuals use a fixed phrase repertoire to create new phrase pairings when they
  acquire a new partner. Furthermore, immediately after pairing, individuals perform
  duets with poor coordination and poor duet code adherence, but both aspects improve
  with time. These results indicate that individuals need a learning period to be
  able to perform well-coordinated duets that follow a consistent duet code. We conclude
  that both duet coordination and duet code adherence are honest indicators of pair-bond
  duration.'
