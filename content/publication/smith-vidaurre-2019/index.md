abstract: <p>Despite longstanding interest in the evolutionary origins and maintenance
  of vocal learning, we know relatively little about how social dynamics influence
  vocal learning processes in natural populations. The “signaling group membership”
  hypothesis proposes that socially learned calls evolved and are maintained as signals
  of group membership. However, in fission–fusion societies, individuals can interact
  in social groups across various social scales. For learned calls to signal group
  membership over multiple social scales, they must contain information about group
  membership over each of these scales, a concept termed “hierarchical mapping.” Monk
  parakeets (Myiopsitta monachus), small parrots native to South America, exhibit
  vocal mimicry in captivity and fission–fusion social dynamics in the wild. We examined
  patterns of contact call acoustic similarity in Uruguay to test the hierarchical
  mapping assumption of the signaling group membership hypothesis. We also asked whether
  geographic variation patterns matched regional dialects or geographic clines that
  have been documented in other vocal learning species. We used visual inspection,
  spectrographic cross-correlation and random forests, a machine learning approach,
  to evaluate contact call similarity. We compared acoustic similarity across social
  scales and geographic distance using Mantel tests and spatial autocorrelation. We
  found high similarity within individuals, and low, albeit significant, similarity
  within groups at the pair, flock and site social scales. Patterns of acoustic similarity
  over geographic distance did not match mosaic or graded patterns expected in dialectal
  or clinal variation. Our findings suggest that monk parakeet social interactions
  rely more heavily upon individual recognition than group membership at higher social
  scales.</p>
