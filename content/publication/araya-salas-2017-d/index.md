abstract: 'When using signals to attract mates or defend resources, animals often
  overlap the voices of other in-dividuals in close proximity. In such contexts signal
  masking is likely and animals would benefit by adopting behavioural strategies that
  modify the timing of signals to minimize the negative effects of masking or take
  advantage of its signalling value. Indeed, temporal coordination has been commonly
  described in a wide variety of taxa, but compelling evidence demonstrating that
  it arises as an active process is scarce. Here we investigate the degree of coordinated
  singing by lekking long-billed hermit hummingbirds, Phaethornis longirostris, in
  the Neotropics, using randomization tests to study the timing of vocal signals.
  We first demonstrate that a randomization statistical approach is robust at detecting
  coordinated singing in simulated data. Then, we show that long-billed hermits engage
  in vocal in-teractions in which either song alternation or song overlap is used.
  Furthermore, we show that singing behaviour varies with the distance between singers:
  hermits alternate their songs when they are in close proximity, and they overlap
  songs at farther distances. Birds achieve these two behaviours by modifying the
  time intervals between signals. The association between pattern of coordination
  and distance is not fully explained by any of the current hypotheses for song overlap
  and suggests that multiple context-dependent singing strategies could be involved.
  Our findings provide compelling evidence on vocal coordination as an active process
  in this species and validate an analytical approach that could be extended to investigate
  similar patterns in other taxa.'
