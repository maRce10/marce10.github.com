abstract: "An increasing number of studies report coordinated chick provisioning by\
  \ avian parents. Although the pattern of parental coordination varies across species,\
  \ broad occurrence of this coordination suggests that it has an adaptive value:\
  \ it may increase individual fitness via higher offspring survival, faster offspring\
  \ growth rate and/or higher body reserves of the parents. However, to what extent\
  \ the pattern of coordinated provisioning in a species represents a flexible response\
  \ to current foraging conditions remains an open question. Here, we examined coordination\
  \ of chick provisioning in the Little Auk (Alle alle), a planktivorous seabird species\
  \ that breeds in the Arctic. Harsh environmental conditions impose bi-parental care\
  \ on this species, and high variability within and across breeding seasons promotes\
  \ flexibility in parental involvement to secure breeding success. During the chick\
  \ rearing period, parents exhibit a dual-foraging strategy (i.e., alternating long\
  \ foraging trips, serving to maintain the adults' body reserves, with several short\
  \ trips aimed to provision the chick). We examined coordination of parental provisioning\
  \ across five breeding seasons varying in terms of environmental conditions and\
  \ found that the parents indeed coordinate their provisioning, avoiding performing\
  \ long trips simultaneously and thus enabling a more even distribution of feeding\
  \ through time. We also examined chick body condition in relation to the level of\
  \ parental coordination to test the potential adaptive value of coordination, but\
  \ we found no significant relationship between these two parameters. We found high\
  \ variability in the level of the coordination between pairs, and this variability\
  \ was similar across all study seasons, which represented a wide range of experienced\
  \ environmental conditions. Nevertheless, we found that the energy density of food\
  \ loads delivered to chicks was associated with the level of parental coordination:\
  \ when conditions were characterized by the delivery of higher-energy food loads,\
  \ the level of coordination exhibited by the studied population was higher. These\
  \ findings suggest that environmental conditions somehow affect parental coordination,\
  \ but the range of the environmental variation could be still below a critical threshold\
  \ of extreme conditions that would trigger more pronounced modifications of parental\
  \ foraging patterns and coordination."
