abstract: Animal cognition experiments frequently reveal striking individual variation
  but rarely consider its causes and largely ignore its potential consequences. Studies
  often focus on a subset of high-performing subjects, sometimes viewing evidence
  from a single individual as sufficient to demonstrate the cognitive capacity of
  a species. We argue that the emphasis on demonstrating species-level cognitive capacities
  detracts from the value of individual variation in understanding cognitive development
  and evolution. We consider developmental and evolutionary interpretations of individual
  variation and use meta-analyses of data from published studies to examine predictors
  of individual performance. We show that reliance on small sample sizes precludes
  robust conclusions about individual abilities as well as inter- and intraspecific
  differences. We advocate standardization of experimental protocols and pooling of
  data between laboratories to improve statistical rigour. Our analyses show that
  cognitive performance is influenced by age, sex, rearing conditions and previous
  experience. These effects limit the validity of comparative analyses unless developmental
  histories are taken into account, and complicate attempts to understand how cognitive
  traits are expressed and selected under natural conditions. Further understanding
  of cognitive evolution requires efforts to elucidate the heritability of cognitive
  traits and establish whether elevated cognitive performance confers fitness advantages
  in nature.
