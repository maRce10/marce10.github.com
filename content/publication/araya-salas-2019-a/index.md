abstract: The study of animal acoustic signals is a central tool for many fields in
  ecology and evolution, but the diversity of analytical methods and sources of animal
  sound recordings poses important challenges for carrying out robust acoustic analyses.
  Sound file compression and background noise may both affect acoustic analysis, although
  little attention has been paid to their respective effects. We evaluated the effect
  of these factors by assessing the systematic deviation (i.e. bias) and measurement
  error (i.e. precision) that they generate on spectrographic parameters and two (dis)similarity
  methods (dynamic time warping on frequency contours and cross-correlation), which
  represent the most common methods currently used for quantitative characterization
  of acoustic signals. Measurements were taken across a wide range of signals from
  a diverse group of bird species, and compared between uncompressed files and decompressed
  files obtained from mp3-encoded files generated using the two most common mp3 encoders
  (Fraunhofer and LAME). Measurements were also compared across a range of synthetically-generated
  background noise levels. Compression did not significantly bias any of the acoustic
  or similarity measurements. However, the precision of acoustic parameters representing
  single extreme values (e.g. peak frequency) as well as dynamic time warping distances,
  was strongly affected by compression. High background noise biased most energy distribution-related
  parameters (e.g. spectral entropy) and affected the precision of most acoustic parameters
  and dynamic time warping. Overall, compression and background noise did have considerable
  effects on acoustic analyses. We provide recommendations to avoid potential pitfalls
  and maximize the information that can be reliably obtained.
