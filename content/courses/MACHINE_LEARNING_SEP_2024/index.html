<p>Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence focused on developing algorithms and models that enable computers to learn patterns and make predictions for data-driven decision-making. Instead of following explicit instructions to perform a task, these algorithms identify patterns in data and use them to improve their performance on specific tasks. Statistical learning is applied in a wide range of areas, from voice recognition to analyzing large datasets and automating industrial processes. In this course, students will learn the fundamentals and basic techniques of statistical learning to address research questions in Cognitive Sciences.</p>
