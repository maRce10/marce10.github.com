I'm a third-year undergraduate student majoring in Biology at the University of Costa Rica. My academic journey has been focused on the application of computational tools to deepen our understanding of the ecological roles played by diverse animals, including amphibians, birds, and mammals. By utilizing these tools, I actively contribute to the development of enhanced conservation efforts.

Presently, I am engaged in the development of [an R package (suwo)](https://github.com/maRce10/suwo) that facilitates searches of species observation data, incorporating multimedia files from multiple biological databases such as [GBIF](https://www.gbif.org) and [iNaturalist](https://www.inaturalist.org). By streamlining access to these vast datasets, we can gain valuable insights into species distributions, behavior, and interactions, ultimately aiding conservation initiatives.

Looking ahead, I am motivated to continue expanding my knowledge and expertise in computational biology tools. My primary goal is to contribute to the preservation of our planet's diverse ecosystems. By leveraging the power of technology, data analysis, and programming, I aspire to develop innovative solutions that address pressing ecological challenges and promote sustainable conservation practices.
