<p>I´m undergraduate bachelor student at the University of Costa Rica. My academic interest gravitate around the captivating wonders of neotropical forests, with a particular emphasis on ornithology and ichthyology studies as well as the ecology, taxonomy, and behavior of the species found within these habitats. Currently, my research focuses on understanding the fascinating relationship between beak length in hummingbirds, beak dimorphism and its influence on their flower selection preferences.</p>
