I am currently in my forth-year as an undergraduate biology student at the University of Costa Rica. My main focus is in wildlife management, ecology, ecosystem conservation, animal behavior and climate change. Iâ€™m mainly interested in mammals, specially bats and birds. I am currently working on a project trying to understand the ecological and social factors that have shaped the structure of distress calls in bats during evolutionary time.
