<p>I am currently in my forth-year as an undergraduate biology student at the University of Costa Rica. My main focus is in wildlife management, ecology, ecosystem conservation, animal behavior and climate change. I’m mainly interested in mammals, specially bats and birds. I am currently working on a project trying to understand the ecological and social factors that have shaped the structure of distress calls in bats during evolutionary time.</p>
